## Spell a number in English

Write a function that takes an integer and returns the number in English.  It should support numbers up to one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less).

### Example

```javascript
f(154)
// => "one hundred fifty-four"

f(9000)
// => "nine thousand"
```
