Given a 2 dimensional array of whole numbers please tell me the fewest amount of steps it would take to get from the smallest number to the highest number in the 2D array. Steps must be made to larger or same value numbers and can be horizontal and vertical but not diagonal.

i.e. 2 -> 2 or 2 -> 4 but NOT 2 -> 1

Example to give
```
[
[4, 5, 2],
[3, 1, 6],
[7, 8, 9]
]

Steps = 2
