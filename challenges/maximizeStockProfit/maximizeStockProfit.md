# Maximize stock profit

## Problem
Given a list of stock prices for a given day as an array of numbers, return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock and then selling the stock later that day.  If no profit could have been made, return -1.

## Example
```javascript
f([45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11])
// => 16
// the largest possible profit from this day is from buying the stock
// at $24 and selling it at $40 to make $16
```
