# Seven-sided dice

## Problem

Given an existing function `dice5` that is an equal-probability generator of one of the integers 1 to 5, create a function `dice7` that generates a pseudo-random integer from 1 to 7 in equal probability using only `dice5` as a source of random numbers.

Bonus points: check the distribution by running your function a million times.
