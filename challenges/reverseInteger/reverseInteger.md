## LeetCode - Easy. Reverse Integer
## Problem
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.


Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within t
he 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


## Example 1
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

## Example 2
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

## Example 3
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```
