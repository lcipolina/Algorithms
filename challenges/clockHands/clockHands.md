# Clock hands

## Problem

Write a function that takes an integer that represents where the minute hand currently is on
a clock, and returns the angle formed by the minute hand and the 12 o'clock mark.

## Example

```javascript
f(15)
// => 90
```

## Extra credit

Write a function that takes two integers that represent the hour and minute values of a
time, and returns the angle formed by the hour and minute hand on a clock.  Keep in
mind that the hour hand advances as the minute hands do.
