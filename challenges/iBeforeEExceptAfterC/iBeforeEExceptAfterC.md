# I before E except after C

## Problem

The phrase `"I before E, except after C"` is a widely known mnemonic which is supposed to help when spelling English words.


Task
Using the word list from http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, 
check if the two sub-clauses of the phrase are plausible individually:

1)  "I before E when not preceded by C"
2)  "E before I when preceded by C"

If both sub-phrases are plausible then the original phrase can be said to be plausible.

Something is plausible if **the number of words having the feature is more than two times the number of words having the opposite feature** (where feature is 'ie' or 'ei' preceded or not by 'c' as appropriate).

(I know, I know, it also goes "and when sounding like A as in neighbor or weigh"!  But that's too hard ðŸ˜‚)
