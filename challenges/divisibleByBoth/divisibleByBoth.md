# Divisible by both

## Problem
Write a function that takes three arguments, and determines whether the first argument is
divisible by both of the other two.  Assume all inputs are positive integers.

## Example
```javascript
f(100, 5, 4)
// => true
f(100, 5, 3)
// => false
f(10, 9, 8)
// => false
```
